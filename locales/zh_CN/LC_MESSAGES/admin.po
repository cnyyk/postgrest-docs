"PostgREST is a fast way to construct a RESTful API. Its default behavior "
"is great for scaffolding in development. When it's time to go to "
"production it works great too, as long as you take precautions. PostgREST"
" is a small sharp tool that focuses on performing the API-to-database "
"mapping. We rely on a reverse proxy like Nginx for additional safeguards."

"The first step is to create an Nginx configuration file that proxies "
"requests to an underlying PostgREST server."

msgid "Block Full-Table Operations"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/admin.rst:44
msgid ""
"Each table in the admin-selected schema gets exposed as a top level "
"route. Client requests are executed by certain database roles depending "
"on their authentication. All HTTP verbs are supported that correspond to "
"actions permitted to the role. For instance if the active role can drop "
"rows of the table then the DELETE verb is allowed for clients. Here's an "
"API request to delete old rows from a hypothetical logs table:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/admin.rst:56
msgid ""
"However it's very easy to delete the **entire table** by omitting the "
"query parameter!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/admin.rst:68
msgid ""
"This can happen accidentally such as by switching a request from a GET to"
" a DELETE. To protect against accidental operations use the `pg-"
"safeupdate <https://github.com/eradman/pg-safeupdate>`_ PostgreSQL "
"extension. It raises an error if UPDATE or DELETE are executed without "
"specifying conditions. To install it you can use the `PGXN "
"<https://pgxn.org/>`_ network:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/admin.rst:77
msgid ""
"This does not protect against malicious actions, since someone can add a "
"url parameter that does not affect the result set. To prevent this you "
"must turn to database permissions, forbidding the wrong people from "
"deleting rows, and using `row-level security "
"<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html>`_ if finer"
" access control is required."

msgid "Count-Header DoS"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/admin.rst:82

"For convenience to client-side pagination controls PostgREST supports "
"counting and reporting total table size in its response. As described in "
":ref:`limits`, responses ordinarily include a range but leave the total "
"unspecified like"

"However including the request header :code:`Prefer: count=exact` "
"calculates and includes the full count:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/admin.rst:98
msgid ""
"This is fine in small tables, but count performance degrades in big "
"tables due to the MVCC architecture of PostgreSQL. For very large tables "
"it can take a very long time to retrieve the results which allows a "
"denial of service attack. The solution is to strip this header from all "
"requests:"

"Nginx supports \"leaky bucket\" rate limiting (see `official docs "

" standard Nginx configuration, routes can be grouped into *request zones*"
" for rate limiting. For instance we can define a zone for login attempts:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/admin.rst:120
msgid ""
"This creates a shared memory zone called \"login\" to store a log of IP "
"addresses that access the rate limited urls. The space reserved, 10 MB "
"(:code:`10m`) will give us enough space to store a history of 160k "
"requests. We have chosen to allow only allow one request per second "
"(:code:`1r/s`)."

" this setting is incompatible with external connection poolers such as "
"PgBouncer working in transaction pooling mode. In this case, you need to "
"set the :ref:`db-prepared-statements` config option to ``false``. On the "

"statement pooling is not compatible at all."
